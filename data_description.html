<h3>ABOUT THE DATA</h3>
<br>
<p>

VARIABLES IN THE DATA SET 


RainTomorrow: The target variable. Did it rain the following day? YES/NO
Date: The date of observation
Location: The common name of the location of the weather station
MinTemp: The minimum temperature in degrees celsius
MaxTemp: The maximum temperature in degrees celsius
Rainfall: The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm
Evaporation: The so-called Class A pan evaporation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am
Sunshine: The number of hours of bright sunshine in the day.
WindGustDir: The direction of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight
WindGustSpeed: The speed (km/h) of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours tomidnight
WindDir9am: Direction of the wind at 9am
WindDir3p: Direction of the wind at 3pm
WindSpeed9am: Wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 9am
WindSpeed3pm: Wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 3pm
Humidity9a: Humidity (percent) at 9am
Humidity3pm: Humidity (percent) at 3pm
Pressure9am: Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 9am
Pressure3pm: Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 3pm
Cloud9am: Fraction of sky obscured by cloud at 9am. This is measured in "oktas", which are a unit of eigths. It records how many eigths of the sky are obscured by cloud. A 0 measure indicates completely clear sky whilst an 8 indicates that it is completely overcast.
Cloud3pm: Fraction of sky obscured by cloud (in "oktas": eighths) at 3pm. See Cload9am for a description of the values
Temp9am: Temperature (degrees C) at 9am
Temp3pm: Temperature (degrees C) at 3pm
RainToday: Boolean: 1 if precipitation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am exceeds 1mm, otherwise 0
RISK_MM: The amount of next day rain in mm. Used to create response variable RainTomorrow. A kind of measure of the "risk". Will be left out in the model.
