In this project, we used four machine learning models to predict whether it will rain tomorrow in Australia, and compared the effectiveness of each model. The models used were: Logistic Regression, Neural Network, SVM, and Naive Bayes.  
In order to present our findings, we created a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
